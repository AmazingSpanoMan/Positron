# This Repo is now set to "LEGACY"
What does this Mean? - The Positron Project has evolved! We now partner with LDO to produce kits for the new and imporved Positron V3.2

This repo will no longer be updated, and will be moved to [the new Github Repo](https://github.com/Positron3D/Positron) once all files are made available from LDO.

Please join the [The Positron Discord](https://discord.gg/5VCruU6EYv) for the most direct updates, and keep an eye on [Our Website](https://positron3d.com).
