# IMPORTANT FOR THIS FOLDER
Well, not super imporatnt but still - These are just temporary tools that will help with the assembly. We reccomend ABS/ASA for accuracy, but any material will work just as well.

`WirePick` and `XYBeltClamp` should be done in PETG.

`WirePick` is designed to help you fish some cables under the Y rail during assembly.

`XYBeltClamp` is designed to help keep tension in the kinematics system during maintenance tasks such as cleaning idlers. It is not required for assembly.
